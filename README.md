# Clash-Of-Clans-Object-Detection-Using-YOLO11
Computer Vision Project
This repository contains a computer vision project utilizing Ultralytics' YOLO models for object detection. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages GPU acceleration for enhanced performance.
Features
Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for object detection.
GPU acceleration enabled via NVIDIA CUDA.
Step-by-step implementation for setting up and running object detection.


# Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then set up the environment using the following commands:
```
# Check GPU status
 !nvidia-smi

# Install required dependencies
pip install ultralytics
```


Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Computer_Vision2.ipynb
```

Requirements
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
Ultralytics YOLO
CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended)
